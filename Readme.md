## üìù Overview

This project is an intelligent web application that can read and answer questions about any uploaded PDF document. It leverages a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline to ensure the AI's answers are factually grounded in the content of the document.

The app is built with Python, using Streamlit for the user interface and Google's Gemini Pro for the final answer generation.
